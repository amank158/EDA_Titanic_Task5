# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship Task 5.

I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The analysis involved handling missing values, visualizing key patterns through graphs, and summarizing important insights about survival factors.

Key factors like gender, passenger class, and fare amount were found to impact survival rates.
